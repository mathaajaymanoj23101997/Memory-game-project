# Memory Game Project

It is a project in which HTML, CSS and Java Script are used to design the game.
We use different icons, and designed with many features like time, no. of moves, number of stars scored in the game.
Also we use different styles in the design using CSS.
How to Play the Game:
1. First Open "memory.html" on any browser
2. The game wii start after entering into the browser
3. Click on any card by matching with the remaining cards
4. The time wii start from when you clicked on the first card
5. By matching all the cards with the correct cards the game wii be completed
6. Here the number of moves taken are also taken into consideration as they effect number of stars you get
7. When you complete the game it wii show you that "Thankyou the game is completed". And it will also ask you that you will play again or close the game.
